              <p>
               The aim of this project work is to design and develop a web based system that aids the management of estates in Nigeria, helping
               estate administrators keep track of their duties, ministry admin or government official in charge of housing and estates to keep track of their work too,
               as well as help the tenants streamline their duties concerning rentage clearance and payments. To achieve this aim, we have designed the following objectives;
               
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <i class="fa fa-check"></i>We created a secured area in the system for government official - main/ministry admin, as we safely call him, where they can asssign the estate management to 
                  various estate admins and keep track of their work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="fa fa-check"></i>We created a module for estate admin to help ease the workload of their duties. They can as well create and monitor tenants, receives payments, communicate with both the tenants and main admin via messaging without leaving the system and many more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="fa fa-check"></i>Tenants also have their own end where they can carry out their duties - payment of rents, reporting complaints to the estate admins and many more.
                </li>
                
              </ul>
